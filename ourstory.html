      <h2 class="about"> Caf√© Esperanza was founded summer 2017 and is a social enterprise that aims to support the environment by giving 100% of its profits to <a class="link" href="https://treesforlife.org.uk" target="_blank">TreesforLife</a>
        We are a coffee shop based in Peebles, Scottish Borders, offering our customers a selection of vegetarian and vegan foods and beverages. In our first year, we helped to plant over 3,000 trees.
        Our staff currently includes three full-time staff, a CEO, a barista, and a waitress. We also have two part-time volunteers during certain stages of year.
        Taking on our customers feedback, we now look into gaining a dedicated web solution, as so far we only had a Facebook page. We are looking for an intuitive, simple, and easy to navigate web site. Most of our customers are students and young professionals. <h2/>
